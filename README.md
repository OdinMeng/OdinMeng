## GENERAL INFORMATION
**Personal and Academical Interests** - Generally, I'm interested in scientific subjects such as mathematics, informatics and physics. More specifically, I am an enthusiast in Data Science and Machine Learning techniques and I wish to connect these techniques to broader contexts: e.g. applying Data Analysis methods to physics experiments. Moreover, I am also interested in further amplifying my technical toolkit even further; one of them is to learn to use Pandoc and Latex to create neat and clean scientific reports. 

**Technical Knowledge** - Programming in C and Python. Scripting in Unix Bash. Markup languages "Markdown" and "Latex" to write scientifical documents. Main Data Science frameworks with Python: NumPy, Pandas and Scikit-Learn. Web Scraping tools: BeautifulSoup and Selenium (Python). Foundations in Deep Learning: PyTorch with the `torch.nn` module. Data Visualization tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly and Power BI. Database Modelling and Management: Power Designer, Transact-SQL (Microsoft SQL) and SQLite. Generative AI-powered Chatbot Design and Implementation with LangChain. Basic App-building with Streamlit, to deploy Data Science projects. 

**Academic Path**
1. Diploma from the "Da Collo" Institute (linguistic high school) in the academical year 2022-2023: specialization in foreign languages and cultures, which is as follows; English as first language, German as second language and Russian as third language.
2. Currently enrolled in the BsC programme "Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics" at the University of Trieste.
3. Erasmus+ mobility project at the NOVA IMS Information Management School (Lisbon, Portugal), curriculum Data Science. During the exchange semester I have developed [five successful projects](https://github.com/OdinMeng/Nova-IMS-Projects-Portfolio).

**Certificates** - English Level C1 (FCE Cambridge English Assessment); German Level B2 (Goethe-Zertifikat Jugendversion).
